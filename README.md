## 🧠 Key Projects

- **🎯 Employee Attrition Prediction**  
  Built classification models to predict employee turnover using decision trees, logistic regression, and SHAP for explainability.

- **🚲 Bike Share Demand Forecast**  
  Developed short- and long-term forecasts using ARIMA and Prophet models. Improved forecast accuracy by 15% and reduced planning errors by 20%.

- **🧬 Particle Track Classification**  
  Applied tree-based models and dense neural networks to classify particle trajectories from physics experiments. Increased model precision by 10%.

- **🍺 Brewery Data Exploration**  
  Performed data wrangling, feature engineering, and visualization to uncover regional trends in brewery operations and beer attributes.
